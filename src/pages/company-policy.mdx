# Company Policy

Last updated: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}

## Sec 1. Guidance, walk-trough and payment.

At the time of the move, the customer or a representative must be present
during the move at all times, as movers will need guidance. It is
customer's responsibility to do a final "walk-through" at the pickup
location to ensure the movers have taken everything that needs to be
moved. Having the form of payment, you choose to use at the end of the job
ready will save you time and money. Please note: Any payments with a
personal check have to be granted by your moving coordinator.

## Sec 2. Moving cost.

The final cost of your move will be determined by multiplying the actual
number of hours our moving crew had worked by the hourly rate indicated on
your estimate, travel time, the amount of packing materials used, the
amount of valuation coverage and any will be added to the final cost of
your move, additional services listed below (if such services are
provided). All jobs are subject to a 2-hour minimum labor + fixed travel
time.

## Sec 3. Labor time.

Labor time starts upon the arrival of our crew at your location and ends
upon the departure from your final destination. Labor time is calculated
based on 15-minute increments at the rate indicated on the estimate. Any
travel between the origin and the destination is considered to be part of
the labor time.

## Sec 4. Travel time.

Please keep in mind that you will be billed for the travel time from our
parking office to your origin, and for the travel time from your final
destination back to our parking office. Those charges are prorated based
on 15-minute increments and are calculated by the reading of the GPS or
Google Maps. In case if our truck is being delayed by traffic, the
additional time incurred will not be added to the bill.

## Sec 5. Packing materials.

Our trucks carry a standard set of boxes: 5 small, 5 medium, 5 large, 5
picture boxes, 5 wardrobe and 1 bundle of white packing paper. If you feel
like there will be some packing for us to be done, please make sure to
inform us ahead of time, otherwise we'll be limited to our supplies.
All boxes and supplies used on your move are subject to addition charge,
unless specified in your moving estimate.

## Sec 6. Arrival time frame.

Please keep in mind that we do not provide a specific time of arrival. We
offer 2-hour arrival time frames for all jobs scheduled in the morning and
3-hour arrival time frames for all the jobs scheduled in the afternoon.

## Sec 7. Waiting time.

If our crew arrives at your location as agreed, but you're not ready
for us to start the job, you'll be billed for our waiting time.
Please understand that you're holding up our team by not being ready
for the move.

## Sec 8. Parking.

Two parking spaces (to accommodate a 34-foot-long moving truck) should be
provided/secured by the customer. Parking spot must be located within 75
feet from the entrance. In case if a parking permit is needed, it is
customer's responsibility to inform {SITE.businessName}. All parking permits must be obtained by the customer
unless otherwise indicated on the move plan. In case if there is no
parking space available next to the origin/delivery location and the
moving truck needs to be parked in a non-permitted space, it is
customer's responsibility to cover the cost of any parking tickets
issued to {SITE.businessName}.

## Sec 9. Payment and payment forms (for local moves).

For local moves, the payment is required at the end of the move/each
moving day (for multiple days move), before the moving team leaves your
location. The clock will continue running until the payment has been
processed completely. We accept cash, Zelle, debit and all types of credit
cards (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, AMEX) and 4% processing fee will be
applied for all debit and credit card payments.

For credit card payments, the name on the card must match the name the
reservation is under otherwise, an authorization form must be signed by
the person paying for the move.

Any payments with a personal check have to be granted by your moving
coordinator.

## Sec 10. Payment and payment forms (for long distance/interstate moves).

We require cash, credit card, money order/cashier's check (no
personal checks) at the time of delivery for any balance due on
long-distance moves. 4% processing fee will be applied for credit card
payments. For all interstate moves we require 10% deposit on booking stage
to secure crew and truck for your move, another 40% due at the pick-up
time and 50% balance due at the delivery after unloading.

## Sec 11. Additional possible services/charges.

- Grand piano special handling cost: $450.00 (first floor to the first
  floor and/or elevator only).
- Baby Grand piano special handling cost: $300.00 (first floor to the
  first floor and/or elevator only).
- Upright piano: $150 (first floor to the first floor and/or elevator
  only). Please bring to our attention in writing the size and type of
  piano you're moving and also the access you have at both locations.
- Overweight item (over 250 lbs.) handling cost (gun safe/valuable safe,
  etc.): $150.00.
- All hoisting services will be subject to a fee of $40 (per item per
  flight).
- Appliance handling cost (washer/dryer/fridge/stove/freezer): $75/each.
- TV Box - Rent: $15/each.
- Moving blankets: If your shipment will be delivered to a storage
  facility, your warehouse, or loaded into a POD/container or a different
  truck instead of the {SITE.businessName} truck, we will charge you $20 for
  each moving blanket. When you move out or receive your delivery from storage,
  if {SITE.businessName} retrieves the moving blankets, we will refund you
  $10 for each blanket that was charged during the move-in or loading services.

## Sec 12. Piano move.

We do not move large upright pianos up or down flights of stairs inside
the house. We only move pianos from ground to ground floor. Exterior
stairs are fine, but we encourage sending us pictures of entrances at each
location, so that we can confirm that we can move your piano. There may be
circumstances when we cannot safely move items and will need to discuss
the situation with you. If the piano has thin legs (usually the front), we
will not be responsible if they will not go back on if we take them off
(sometimes the nut is loose inside the piano and will turn when you try to
replace the leg). If the customer elects to leave the legs on, we will not
be responsible if damage occurs to them.

## Sec 13. Heavy/Oversized items move.

Under safe conditions, we move upright or baby grand pianos, appliances,
safe and items over 250 lbs. Unfortunately, sometimes, due to the weight
of these items, damage may result to floor surfaces or walls so before we
proceed with moving these items we will have a release of any liability
signed so we can move those items for you.

## Sec 14. Moving Crew size.

The size of the moving crew is determined by the number of items that will
have to be packed and/or moved as well as factors like access on each
moving location, walking distance, stairs, etc. We recommend a certain
number of movers for each job taking in consideration all the above as
well as our current schedule, availability, etc. On extreme situations,
{SITE.businessName} might recommend sending extra men and/or truck during the
day to complete a job if there is an overflow of items that needs to be moved,
or additional packing required, a time restriction, very difficult access or
very difficult pieces of furniture, etc. The hourly rate will be increased
accordingly and the move will run more efficiently with more movers.

## Changes to Our Policy.

We may change our Privacy and Website Use Policy from time to time. The
most current version of the Policy will govern our collection, use and
disclosure of information about you and will be detailed here. If we make
material changes to this Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting
a notice here prior to the effective date of the change. By continuing to
access or use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree
to the revised Privacy and Website Use Policy.
